\section{Visual and Structural}
As the main instruction for LLMs for this study remains an Image-to-Code task, it 
is necessary to evaluate the generated HTML/CSS code based on visual and structural
similarity. One approach which seems very promising has been presented in the 
paper Design2Code. This approach is more fine-grained than former ideas, since 
it compares the input and the output on a component-level rather than in its entirety.
The authors describe a sophisticated matching algorithm that combines the 
HTML elements in the ground truth with those in the generated code. Based on this 
matching, it is then possible to run several metrics, such as text-similarity,
position-similarity, color-difference, clip score and area sum score.
