\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:Conclusion}
This thesis has first systematically evaluated the 
accessibility of HTML/CSS code generated by state-of-the-art 
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) from UI screenshots.
While the models have shown impressive capabilities in 
the generation of syntactically valid code that closely 
mirrors the original UI image, they often reveal 
persistent accessibility violations across all 
models. Through an empirical study and analysis across 
different models, prompting techniques and datasets, 
this thesis identifies the most common accessibility 
violations and highlights gaps in the models' 
understanding of accessibility best practices.\newline
Based on these findings, the thesis discusses a potential 
paradigm shift in the approach of code generation, 
where accessibility should be rethought as a 
first-class objective in AI-driven UI development. 
As MLLMs continue to evolve, the findings of this 
thesis provide valuable insights, implications and 
possible directions for the future of more inclusive 
and responsible web development tools.
